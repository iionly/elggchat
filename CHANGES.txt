Changelog
=========

-----

- Initialize chat user settings with default values correctly if user hasn't saved the user settings yet (thanks to oseg for reporting).

2.0.1
-----

- New plugin option to enable/disable smilies shortcuts to animated gif smilies within chat messages,
- Match smilies shortcodes only if there's a space before to avoid false identification of shortcodes (e.g. as part of urls),
